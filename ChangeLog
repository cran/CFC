Changes in 1.0.1
  * Fixed a bug in C++ source file for vignetter, weib.cpp, exposed by Clang-UBSAN
  * Removed unnecessary warning in summary.cfc.survreg when "all" observations are selected.

Changes in 1.0.0
  * Introducing a new API for CFC, via function "cfc", where instead of pre-generated survival arrays, the fnction expects survival functions and will generate the arrays at time points determined by the quadrature algorithm.
  * A novel quadrature algorithm, named generalized Newton-Cotes, for performing CFC integrals with more stability in cases of end-point singularity.
  * Quadrature algorithm accepts survival functions in both R and C++ mode, the latter using Rcpp and RcppArmadillo framework.
  * Performance optimizations in quadrature algorithm, including OpenMP parallelization
  * The new API also has a convenient wrapper, cfc.survreg, for performing parametric survival regression using package "survival", and submitting the resulting survival curves to CFC.
  * Vignette explaining the API and the quadrature algorithm.
